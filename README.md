Feature Selection based Genetic Algorithm for Storm Surge
This package contains algorithms published in the paper "Genetic algorithm-based wrapper feature selection for storm surge forecasting".
Set of four common regression learning methods including SVM (Support Vector Machine), kNN (k-Nearest Neighbors), (RF) Random Forest (RF) and MLP (Multi-layer perception) used for wrapper-based feature subset selection by using Genetic Algorithm. 
They are implemented as part of the Java-based Weka API.
