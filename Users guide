The following explain how to use them in your own code. 
1. Code#
- in the zip file there are 4 java files that are classes for each machine learning technique(for example nn_functions.java for MLP).
- Run the StormSurgeFs.java file to select the machine learning method for the wrapper features selection and the dataset to execute:
   The first parameter enter 0 if you want to run MLP, 1 for SVM, 2 for kNN, 3 for RF.
- If you want to change the parameters of GA you can add it in method
  private static Instances[] GAWrap(Instances trainData, Instances testData) throws Exception
 in the corresponding classes of machine learning algorithms
2. Datasets#
The datasets are not limited to ARFF files. It can also read CSV files and other formats (basically all file formats that Weka can import via its converters;
it uses the file extension to determine the associated loader).
